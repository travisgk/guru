# guru
A simple framework for building 3D scenes in OpenGL.
<br>
<br>
## Libraries
Guru makes use of the following libraries:
- [GL](https://www.opengl.org/) (OpenGL) - for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
- [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library) - helps the program use advanced graphics features.
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) (OpenGL Mathematics) - help with math for graphics that involve vectors and matrices.
- [SDL 2.3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.1) (Simple DirectMedia Layer) - provides low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware.
- [ASSIMP](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) (Open Asset Import Library) - helps load 3D models into the program.
