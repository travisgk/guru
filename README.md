# guru
A simple OpenGL engine written in C++ for building and rendering 3D scenes.
This was created to explore the fundamentals of 3D graphics.

## Libraries
Guru makes use of the following libraries:
- [GL](https://www.opengl.org/) (OpenGL, v4.6) - for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
- [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) (v2) - used for loading OpenGL function pointers, enabling cross-platform development.
- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) (v3.3.9) - provides low-level access for creating windows, creating contexts and surfaces, and reading input.
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) (OpenGL Mathematics, v0.9.9) - help with math for graphics that involve vectors and matrices.
- [ASSIMP](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) (Open Asset Import Library) - helps load 3D models into the program.
- [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) (v2.29) - a single-file library used for loading image data. no installation needed, this file is included in the source code.

## Installation

## Future Implementations
- SpotLight implementation in the default shader code.
- Shadow mapping.
- Bloom FX.
- Mac OS support.
